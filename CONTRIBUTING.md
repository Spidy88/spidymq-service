# How to contribute

Contributions welcome! Just please stick to these guidelines to ease the process on the repo owner and fellow 
contributors.

## Before submitting changes

Before submitting a change, submit an issue. Issues are a great way to organize and discuss the road map of this 
repository. You do not have to wait for an issue to be "accepted" before submitting a PR, but please be open to 
questions, alterations, and possibly even rejections.

## Creating issues

Issues can quickly get out of control. To keep things organized, please follow these simple rules when creating an 
issue.

  1. All issues should be created in English
  2. All titles should start with a label (described below)
  3. All titles should be short and as obvious as possible
  4. All titles should be cased like a regular english sentence
  5. All issues should be labeled

Issue prefixes and tags:
  * Documentation:
    * Title prefix: `[DOCS]`
    * Tagged: `docs`
  * Bugs:
    * Title prefix: `[BUG]`
    * Tagged: `bug`
  * Feature requests:
    * Title prefix: `[FEATURE]`
    * Tagged: `feature`

## Submitting changes

To submit a change, create a branch off of `master` using the naming rules below. Keep the commit history clean and
easy to follow. Commits messages should be descriptive and short. Pull requests should identify the issue or issues 
it addresses, though most should only address a single issue.

  1. All pr branches should be named lowercase with - to split up words (i.e. feature/oauth-login)
  2. All branches should be prefixed as described below

Pull request branch prefixes:
  * Documentation: `docs/`
  * Bugs: `bugfix/`
  * Feature requests: `feature/`
